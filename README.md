●   Prepare a Makefile as an automated build tool

●   Prepare instructions for using your repository. 

### Task 3.2. JS Event Listeners

**Task Objective:**  This task involves practice working with [browser event listeners](https://javascript.info/introduction-browser-events) to create effects that react in real-time to user input. You will be creating an input mask on a text input and providing a message to the user about their input.
